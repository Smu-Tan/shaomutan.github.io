											<h1>Hi there, I’m Shaomu Tan<br />
											</h1>
											<p>Currently pursuing my PhD</p>
										</header>
										<p>I'm a PhD candidate at Language Technology Lab (LTL), University of Amsterdam. My research domains mainly about Natural Language Processing, especially Multilingual Neural Machine Tranlsation. I enjoy working with colleagues at LTL, and happy to be supervised by Dr. Prof. Christof Monz.</p>

									<h2>Master thesis supervision</h2>
								</header>
								
								<p>I'm currently looking for master and bachelor students to supervise your thesis project. Please contact me if you're interested in the following projects! Note: If you have other interesting domains in Natural Language Processing, feel free to contact me as well, we could discuss potential feasibilities!</p>

									<h3>Thesis project for AI/DS/CL-related Master students</h3>
									<strong>Toward alleviating the off-target issue in Multilingual Neural Machine Translation</strong> 
									<p>Multilingual Neural Machine Translation (MNMT) has shown the potential to conduct zero-shot and even unsupervised translation tasks. Nonetheless, several studies have revealed that MNMT systems tend to generate translations in unexpected or wrong languages (known as the off-target issue), especially in the zero-shot translation scenarios. This project aims to investigate possible reasons and explore potential solutions for off-target issues to improve the zero-shot MNMT.</p>

									<h3>Thesis project for AI/DS/CL-related Bachelor students</h3>
									<strong>Exploring morphologically-enhanced subword tokenization for low-resource machine translation</strong> 
									<p>The development of subword tokenization methods, such as Byte Pair Encoding, and SentencePiece, help NLP models better cope with the Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) problem and alleviate data sparsity issues. However, recent Machine Translation tasks have reported that when facing Morphologically Rich Low-resource Languages (MRLL), existing subword tokenization may not be able to output effective subword units only using limited data. Therefore, in this project, we aim to improve subword tokenization for MRLL, considering their morphological features with the help of linguistic tools. Ultimately, we will validate our method on machine translation-related tasks.</p>
									<strong>Transfer pre-trained language models to sequence-to-sequence translation models</strong> 
									<p>Neural pre-trained language models (PLMs) such as GPT-3 have demonstrated their superiority in various language generation tasks. Intuitively, transferring a pre-trained language model to a transformer-based Machine Translation (MT) model can be seen as taking advantage of better parameter initialization. The project aims to explore efficient MT model initialization using transfer learning.</p>
									<strong>Sequential Copying Network for Question-Context Summarization</strong> 
									<p>Conversational Question Answering (ConvQA) is a rising domain aiming to answer human questions in the conversational setting automatically. Under this setting, machines have to refer to the current question and the context in this conversation record (prior QA pairs), as well as possible external knowledge such as Wikipedia. Recent studies have reported that ConvQA models are susceptible to such long input sequences and thus cannot focus on helpful information. This project explores the feasibility of using sequential copying networks for question-context summarization in the ConvQA setting.</p>

								<h4>Work environment</h4>
								<p>You will join the Language Technology Lab (LTL), a research group focusing on information access from natural language data. Our work ranges from basic research in natural language processing to key applications in human language technology and covers areas such as machine translation, summarization, question answering, language modeling, and image captioning. Take a look at the group’s website ltl.science.uva.nl for more details. You will have at least one main supervisor for your project, who will be available to meet up regularly. Also we, as a group, actively publish our work at top-tier conferences, thus for those interested in pursuing a research career, we are well suited to provide feedback on your project and support the publication of your work.</p>
